# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with spaCy and Transformers

## Project Overview
This project is a Twitter sentiment analysis tool using spaCy and a pre-trained transformer model. The goal is to classify tweets as positive or negative in sentiment, providing valuable insights for analyzing public opinion, brand sentiment, and social media feedback. The project includes data processing, model evaluation, and visualization of performance metrics, making it easy to understand and interpret results.

## Key Features
- **Pre-trained Transformer Model Integration**: Uses a transformer model in spaCy to classify sentiment in tweets.
- **Efficient Data Pipeline**: Processes text data using spaCy for NLP tasks like tokenization, embedding, and sentiment prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculates essential metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization of Model Performance**: Generates confusion matrices, learning curves, and ROC curves to assess model performance.
- **Interactive Model Testing**: Allows for real-time testing and prediction on custom inputs.

## Project Structure
- `sentiment_spacy.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook for data processing, training, and evaluation.
