# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with spaCy and Transformers

## Project Overview
This project is a Twitter sentiment analysis tool using spaCy and a pre-trained transformer model. The goal is to classify tweets as positive or negative in sentiment, providing valuable insights for analyzing public opinion, brand sentiment, and social media feedback. The project includes data processing, model evaluation, and visualization of performance metrics, making it easy to understand and interpret results.

## Key Features
- **Pre-trained Transformer Model Integration**: Uses a transformer model in spaCy to classify sentiment in tweets.
- **Efficient Data Pipeline**: Processes text data using spaCy for NLP tasks like tokenization, embedding, and sentiment prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculates essential metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization of Model Performance**: Generates confusion matrices, learning curves, and ROC curves to assess model performance.
- **Interactive Model Testing**: Allows for real-time testing and prediction on custom inputs.

## Project Structure
- `sentiment_spacy.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook for data processing, training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Contains datasets, including labeled tweets with sentiment tags.
- `models/`: Directory for storing the trained model and any model-related files.
- `results/`: Stores the output from evaluations, such as performance visualizations and metrics.
- `src/`: Core project code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This project requires the following libraries:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- `spaCy`
- `transformers`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- `pandas` and `numpy`

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### INSTALLATION
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-sentiment-analysis-spacy.git
```
```bash
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis-spacy
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Data Loading and Preparation: Load your dataset of tweets with sentiment labels into the data/ directory. The notebook sentiment_spacy.ipynb will guide you through preprocessing steps.

## Training and Evaluation:

-Open sentiment_spacy.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the cells step-by-step to process data, initialize the transformer model, and perform model training.
Model Evaluation:

-The notebook includes steps to evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualizations such as ROC curves and confusion matrices will be generated to better understand model performance.
Interactive Testing:

-After training, you can use the notebook to test the model on new tweets or sample inputs for live sentiment prediction.
Results and Analysis
The project generates various evaluation metrics and visualizations, including:

### Confusion Matrix: Shows the breakdown of true vs. false predictions.
-Learning Curves: Provides insights into how the model's accuracy improves with more data.
-ROC Curve: Illustrates the modelâ€™s performance in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments.

## Future Enhancements

### Expand Sentiment Classes: Extend the model to classify sentiments beyond binary (e.g., neutral, very positive).
-Model Fine-tuning: Explore further fine-tuning of transformer layers for improved accuracy.
-Real-Time Data: Integrate a live feed of tweets for real-time sentiment analysis.
